*A Subscription Management Library that is database agnostic and is flexible around any kind of subscription model.*

_This library aims to be an easy solution to managing subscription problems_. It aims to be database agnosting by providing abstractions around the storage system and the subscription modules. Each subscription extends the base subscription class and you can get started by writing your own subcription class and using the memory storage to quickly test out your subscription systems.
